wallpaper edits by me.

i have decided to put all of my wallpaper edits on one central place. i just happen to have a GitHub account lying around (it was initially just to get the free Canva Pro offer) and apparently hosting files here is a pretty good idea because 1) it's one way to not get any Google Drive folder open to the general public, and 2) there's only an individual file size limit to watch out for, one that's not likely to be reached by mere 1080p .png files.

edits are done with a combination of apps, including:
- Canva
- PicsArt
- Instagram Stories edit

do keep in mind this is a personal collection made public, so most of the wallpapers were made with my own devices in mind, which means that most edits, especially older ones, are only available for one orientation (portrait/landscape), aspect ratio (mostly 9:16), and/or resolution (between 720p and 1080p).
